# red-utils

**Important**: This is my first Python package. I'm experimenting with CI/CD and Pypi. This library is most likely not useful to anyone else.

# Description

A collection of utility scripts/functions that I use frequently. Includes helper functions/default variables for libraries like `loguru`, `diskcache`, and `msgpack`.

# Installation
